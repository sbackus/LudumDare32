VIt takes more than a day of hard hiking to reach Echomount; it's close to dusk the next day as you draw close to the deep crater where the elders of the Wilderkind meet. You can see the flicker of campfires; the conclave is already gathered. \u000a\u000aThe elders are no doubt eager to sort out the trouble of the drought and the conflict with Carillon. Hopefully, you're in time to have a voice at the table. \u000a\u000a[[...|halt]]

VHe smiles. "I serve at the pleasure of the masters, which is a great honor. My mother hopes I'll become one someday, and I may yet. But, the truth is... I have a business, a small one, and I //am// looking forward to getting back. \u000a\u000a"I'm no good with big spells, like you or Alda, but I have a talent for small ones, one that require more subtlety than strength. I can find people, or lost objects, or make light, or fix things." He laughs. "A handyman, more or less. But, you know. With magic." He grins sheepishly. "I have to admit, though, I can't wait to get back to it."\u000a\u000a[[...|alda talk]]

VOrit excuses himself - you can see that he's exhausted, and already a line of elders is forming to talk to him one-on-one. He's got work to do yet before he sleeps. You let him go. \u000a\u000aAlda approaches you, smiling warmly. "You," she says, "did extremely well, Jes.

I wanted to leave all of it behind. Being out here, among the Wilderkind, it felt good. But some people, at first, were like that sentry - I was just a caroler to them." She shrugs. "I got used to not talking about it. \u000a\u000a"But I should have told you. I guess Carillon City isn't the only one that needs to think about being a better neighbor. Tell you what - when we get back, I'll tell you all about it - while we dig out your irrigation ditch."\u000a\u000aYou laugh.

I know it's not quite the way that most Wilderkind prefer to use magic. A bell is not a private instrument." \u000a\u000a"No," you say, "but now that I've used one, I don't think it's such a bad thing." \u000a\u000a"When we get back home," she says, "I will teach you everything that you want to know.
