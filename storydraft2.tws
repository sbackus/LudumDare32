V<<set $bell to 0>>You're in the west field, ankle-deep in the muck of an irrigation ditch, frowning down at the mud squelching around your boots. There's not enough water. \u000a\u000aYou climb out of the ditch and look around, pursing your lips. The field is filled with promising green shoots, but the soil is dry and sandy. And beyond the field, the waters of the small lake that provide water for your small farm and your neighbor's are visibly low. \u000a\u000aYou look up at the sky. Dark clouds race overhead. They promise rain, but you know the rain won't fall here. The clouds will speed on to where the Ringers of Carillon City are calling them. \u000a\u000a[[...|bells]]

VSpeaking of which - a low peal of bells becomes audible. \u000a\u000aThe City is miles away, far longer than the sound would ordinary carry. But when they Ring their bells, instead of just ringing them, the sound moves in strange ways. \u000a\u000aYou open your mouth and sing to your self, soft and wordless. The air shifts around you, and there's a faint glow as a shield materializes around you, blocking out the sound. \u000a\u000aYou smile; the Carolers aren't the only ones with magic. \u000a\u000a[[...|waters]]

VAlthough they are more or less the only ones with water, in the middle of this drought. They've always called the rains to water their crops, but as the land gets drier, as the wells dry up and the lakes and pools get lower, they do it more and more. \u000a\u000aOr maybe, like some say, the more they call the rains the drier the land gets.\u000a\u000aYou don't know if it's true or not, but a lot of people more desperate than you have become convinced that Carillon's endless calling is the real cause of the drought.

VBut that's still far away, for now. For now you have a field, and a crop you're counting on, and too little water. You contemplate the ditch. Perhaps you could dig it deeper to draw more water out to your field? Or perhaps you should resort to getting water by the bucket field and watering the crops by hand?\u000a\u000aBoth approaches are a lot of work. You'd probably need help from Alda, your one neighbor who lives on the other side of the lake.

V"Thank you for your help," Orit says formally. "You are clearly a talented Singer," he says. But despite his politeness, he watches you with suspicion.\u000a\u000aYou gesture at the chime in his hands. "And you're a good Ringer." You didn't just follow the sound to them; the echoing of the caverns should have made that impossible. He showed you the way.\u000a\u000a"Thank you." He bows his head to accept the compliment. The light is dimming, and he strikes the chime again, with a small wooden rod he holds in his other hand. The glow, which was starting to fade with the sound, comes back. \u000a\u000a[[...|questions]]\u000a

V"Yes - I'd forgotten all about your farm." He frowns, looking genuinely worried. "I hope you haven't lost too much ground - and with the drought and everything too. Please, when you get home, send me word. If you incurred any great loss on my behalf - on my city's behalf - well, I promise you I'll make it right."\u000a\u000aIt's a kind offer, kind enough that you aren't quite sure what to respond. "What did you leave undone, back in Carillon City?" you ask. "You must have a life besides this."\u000a\u000a[[...|normal2]]\u000a

Your bell is a large golden hand-bell with a hardwoord handle, a gift from Orit and his mother before you left the city.\u000a\u000a"A little piece of the city and its spirit you can take with you," Orit said. He pointed out the inscription along the sound rim: "Friend of Carillon." \u000a\u000aNow you and Alda stand on the crest of the rise between your properties, preparing to join together in a ritual that's familiar to her but strange for you - calling the rain. \u000a\u000a[[...|bell2]]

This is the second day you've given them this treatment; it's too soon to tell what the outcome will be, but the soil is darker and seems to be holding more of the moisture today.

VYou start with an innovation unique to the Wilderlands, however - you sing a shield, a small one, not completely enclosing the two of you but just on either side along the ground - hopefully enough to channel the sound up and away from your neighbors. You have no desire to be a nuisance to anyone. Singing around Alda is a new experience, a new intimacy - but it's not uncommon between neighbors who have gotten to know each other. \u000a\u000a"I'll start," Alda tells you once you're finished. "And then you, and then me again. We build the sound together, let it carry, and then see what happens." \u000a\u000a[[...|bell3]]
